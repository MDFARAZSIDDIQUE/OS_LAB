## Notations

1. Burst Time :- Execution time, unit dosen't matter.
2. Turn-around Time :- Completion time - Arrival time (The amount of time the process stays in a cpu) .
3. Waiting Time :- TAT - BT (The amount of time a process has to wait) .
4. Response Time :- The time at which a process arrives in CPU  - Arrival time.
5. Criteria :- Arrival time
6. Mode : Non Preemptive (Scheduling tasks according to their priorities)
7. Gantt Chart :- A Gantt chart is a project management tool assisting in the planning and scheduling of projects of all sizes.
8.  Context Switching :- Context Switching involves storing the context or state of a process so that it can be reloaded when required and execution can be resumed from the same point as earlier. This is a feature of a multitasking operating system and allows a single CPU to be shared by multiple processes.


## Important Points

1. Job queue − This queue keeps all the processes in the system.

2. Ready queue − This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is always put in this queue.

3. Device queues − The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.

4. For Non Preemptive response time is equal to waiting time.
